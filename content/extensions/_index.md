# Extending

Colmena can be extend by creating *extensions* (custom *modules*) for the API and the Admin.

The idea is that you should be able to add custom functionality without touching the Colmena core as much as possible.

This is achieved by creating and [API Extension](./api-extension) or [Admin Extension](./admin-extension).
