## Colmena

Colmena ([kolËˆmena](https://www.howtopronounce.com/spanish/colmena/)) means *beehive* in Spanish. It is named this way because:

- it has a modular design.
- it aims to be a project that grows by combining forces. 
- it's founder is known as [beeman](https://github.com/beeman).

## LoopBack, Angular and the SDK Builder

The two major projects that Colmena builds on are [LoopBack](https://loopback.io) and [Angular](https://angular.io).

A third important component is the [loopback-sdk-builder](https://github.com/mean-expert-official/loopback-sdk-builder).

The SDK builder generates an TypeScript SDK for the LoopBack server that can be used to builder Angular apps.

Next to these three projects Colmena is built upon a great selection of Free and Open Source projects.

### LoopBack Angular Admin

Colmena is the successor to a project called [loopback-angular-admin](https://github.com/colmena/colmena/tree/loopback-angular-admin#screenshots)
and while it has been re-written from scratch it still shares similar ideas and the same technologies (albeit later versions).
