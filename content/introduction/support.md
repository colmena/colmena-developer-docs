## Help!

No fear! I you get stuck with Colmena there are several ways to get support.

## The project does not run!

A lot of times it can help to run `npm run clean` followed by `npm run install` to get the project in a clean state.

In case of any problems running Colmena or a command in it's project folder this is the first thing you should try.

## I don't like using Colmena

As with most things in life there is no such thing as 'One size fits all' and this is absolutely true for developer tools.

While we love to have you on board you're of course free to go. What we would appreciate if you could let us know why
Colmena does not meet your expectations as this will allow us to further improve the project.
